# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineer program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this, it really challenged my knowledge of animations, BEM Methodology, and file structure. The one thing I would improve is more emphasis on the animations throughout as I had more ideas of where to use pulsate and animation effects.
